# 🧠 DSA Problems

This repository contains my personal practice and solutions for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems from various online platforms like LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, Codeforces, and more.

## 📂 Folder Structure


Each folder contains:
- ✅ Well-structured code files (mostly in C++ / Java / Python)
- 📝 Problem statement or link as a comment at the top
- 💡 Explanation or approach (wherever relevant)
